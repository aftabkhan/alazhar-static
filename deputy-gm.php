                        <p>Praise be to God, prayer and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah .... Quality standards are now an important issue in the field of health, but the direction of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, protected by the God, strive to apply the international standards adopted in the field of health and the highest levels. From this point of view, and from religious and moral principles of society, such as the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), God loves one of you to perform any work in a proper manner. </p>
                        <p>Al Azhar Hospital has been an owner, manager and staff for more than two consecutive decades in accordance with international standards, in an effort to implement them in daily reality and in international standards.</p>
                        <p>Al Azhar Hospital Thanks to God bees and workers exchange roles, with a general sense to everyone that this is their second home and that they share the owner in his property, and thanks to God from success to successes in our daily reality.</p>
                        <p>The owner of the hospital never felt that he was a privileged owner of us. He did not fly outside the squadron during those years. He did not take money for himself. The money was not in his heart . It was in his hand, thank God He was in fact spending the place, equipment, equipment and requirements, the staff and specialties with unmatched generosity, I speak with special knowledge and understanding, and the financial aspect is one of the responsibilities entrusted to me personally.</p>
                        <p>We look forward to the quality and quantity and look forward to achieving the position that suits us among the hospitals operating in Riyadh and Saudi Arabia in general according to the vision, mission and values ​​attached, and according to the vision of the Kingdom 2030</p>
